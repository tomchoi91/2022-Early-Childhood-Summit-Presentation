### Abstract

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early childhood researchers are inherently interested in studying factors forecasting/influencing children’s outcomes at school. Parental involvement in education is one of them. ECLS-K: 2011, a large-scale longitudinal study, has data about parental involvement in education. However, whether its psychometric property is equivalent across time and between groups of individuals is unknown. This study aimed to test whether the items for parental involvement in school have the same meaning over time. The kindergarten to 3rd-grade student sample data was drawn from ECLS-K: 2011 (N=16035). A series of confirmatory factor analysis models were run to examine the factor structure of parental involvement in school. Following the standard guideline for testing measurement invariance of categorical variables, a configural invariance model was set up and then was tested for scalar invariance (Muthén, & Muthén, 1998-2017). The weighted least-squares mean and variance adjusted estimator and probit link function was used for data analysis. All analyses were conducted using Mplus version 8.4. The results showed that scalar invariance was not achieved with given data. Since the full measurement invariance did not hold, partial measurement invariance was sought out. This involves relaxing some equality constraints on the measurement parameters. The backward method (sequentially releasing parameters) was used to identify noninvariant parameters (Putnick & Bornstein, 2016). Implications for the study results will follow.
